      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="lead">Born and bred in Essex to Lao parents, I am currently living and working in London.</p>
      <p>I have <i>lots</i> of hobbies &amp; interests. Here's a little more about me and the things I like to do in my spare time...</p>

      <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p>Drawing was one of my earliest passions, and I still like to draw, paint and design today if I can find the time. Check out some of my paintings, or my DeviantArt profile.</p>
        <p>Musically, I play the piano, guitar, cello and ukulele - maybe we can jam some time?</p>

      <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>As a self-professed geek, I like teaching myself new programming languages and tinkering with tech in my spare time. One of my favourite past times is programming and designing video games and I'm currently doing a Udacity course on C# and Unity.</p>
        <p>Given my engineering background, I also have experience with mathematical modelling software and statistics. Nothing like making a good spreadsheet at the weekend.</p>

      <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>Having learnt how to play tennis from a young age, I play at county level for my tennis club, and represented my university also.</p>
        <p>Other sports that I'm always keen to play are football, hockey, table tennis... and I'm a mean discus thrower too.
